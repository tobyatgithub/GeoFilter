# GeoFilter  
#Part of the 'twitter downloader project' working on for Prof.Henry and his SNAP Lab  
#This filter contains a class where the input is the geoinfo of an interested region  
#(in this case, Rochester as [-78.5401367286, 42.00027541, -76.18272114, 43.3301514])
  
#Inside the class, there is one function called CheckRegion where user would input 
#the geoinfo of an interested point or region, and the function would return T/F
#depending on different condition and thresholds.
